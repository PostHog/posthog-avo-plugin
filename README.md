## About Avo Inspector

_Excerpt from the [Avo docs](https://www.avo.app/docs/workspace/inspector#Overview)._

> The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what's wrong with your data today.
>
> We built the Inspector to help you understand how your current tracking is performing. The Inspector both identifies common issues in your existing tracking, such as inconsistent properties and types, and provides implementation status in the Avo Tracking Plan, so you always know the state of your tracking implementation in your app.
